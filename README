User interface for dynamical simulations, with a Lennard-Jones example.

Copyright 2021 by Radford M. Neal, released under GPL version 3 (see COPYING).


This software implements a framework for interacting with dynamical
simulations in two dimensions. A two-dimensional system of molecules
interacting via a modified Lennard-Jones potential is implemented as
an example.

The software is written in C, using the SFML library (with the CSFML
bindings), as described at sfml-dev.org.  The SFML and CSFML libraries
must be installed, after which "make" should compile the programs.  On
macOS with Homebrew, "brew install SFML" and "brew install CSFML" may
be used to install SFML and CSFML.  On Ubuntu Linux, they may be
installed with "sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev" and "suod apt-get
install libcsfml-dev".

See dynui-doc for futher documentation.
